-- ddresize - dd style cloning utility written in C# .NET 4.5.1

I was working a lot with images for SD cards for using in raspberry pi
and I wanted an imaging utility for Windows that will also copy only the
used partitions total bytes (plus 1MB added for safety) for transfering
those disk images to other SD cards with reduced space size.
This utility is probably not the right way to do such stuff and
I consider it quick and dirty since it was written in about 8 hours
of my free time. Therefore not tested so much as long as it did the job.
